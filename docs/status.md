_A Malmo Project for CompSci 175 at UC Irvine_

## Project Summary

The Survival of the Fittest Project (A CompSci 175 Project) aims to utilize the knowledge regarding machines learning and intelligence system to build a survival agent who can survive the wave of attack from mobs in Minecraft Project Malmo. In the initial proposal, the goal of the project aims to “train the agent with … Zombie Pigman, Wither, Blaze, etc.” and allow the agent to “utilize the terrain to its advantage when given a more complex map.” However, we are facing some feasibility on the current stage. We intend to construct adequate infrastructures (Agent Deep Q Network Method or Agent Neuroevolution of Augmenting Topologies Method, Environment, etc.) to train the agent to fight with all mobs in all terrain. The key objective is to train an agent to survive in a complex environment as long as possible. Longevity is the goal. 

At this stage, the current objective is to establish one of the methods (Deep Q Network or Neuroevolution of Augmenting Topologies) and train the agent to fight with one Zombie in a limited pure environment. The videos would demonstrate our current progress. The Deep Q Network has been utilized and constructed in our agent class to allow it to learn the ideal approach in different situations. The environment is limited to a 21-by-21 cage without any obstacles. The team has added a random environment generator to construct more complex environment, but we have not attempted to train the agent in such environment. 

By the final report time, our team aims to utilize the environment generator to prepare the agent in a more sophisticated manner. We would also improve on our existing Deep Q Network, and possibly also keep trying to build an agent with Neuroevolution of Augmenting Topologies. The complexity of enemies would also be increased by that time. The agent not only needs to survive the constant Zombie attack, but could also face different kinds of attacks from Zombie Pigman, Wither, or Blaze.
