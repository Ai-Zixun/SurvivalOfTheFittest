## Project Summary

The Survival of the Fittest Project (Our Computer Sciences 175: Project in AI) provide an opportunity for our team to design several agents to survive in a complex environment with numerous enemies. From the day one, the team dedicate to an unchanged objective – find, design, and train the best agent to survive in an unpredictable and sophisticated environment to pursuit the goal of longevity.

The project requires us to review, comprehend, and implement what we have learned in CompSci 175, and several other Intelligence System courses – CompSci 171, 177, and 178.

As described in our Status Report, the project has created an agent with Deep Q Network whom can tackle the task of surviving from one Zombie in a limited cage. Two other agents has
