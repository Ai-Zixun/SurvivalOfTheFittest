## Project Summary

The Survival of the Fittest Project (Our Computer Sciences 175: Project in AI) provide an opportunity for our team to design several agents to survive in a complex environment with numerous enemies. From the day one, the team dedicate to an unchanged objective – find, design, and train the best agent to survive in an unpredictable and sophisticated environment to pursuit the goal of longevity.

#### Essential Knowledge
The project requires us to review, comprehend, and implement what we have learned in CompSci 175, and several other Intelligence System courses – CompSci 171, CompSci 177, and CompSci 178. The project utilized Neural Network, Q-Learning, and Neuroevolution of Augmenting Topologies to generate three different agents. Deep Q Network provided the most readily available solution. A neural network delivers an estimation of Q value, and then the agent would determine the best action based on the Q value. Another agent whom the team has been working on is NEAT (Neuroevolution of Augmenting Topologies). NEAT has presented various challenges during the development. It is a powerful method, but the team only has limited knowledge on the subject. Beside Deep Q Network and NEAT, a random agent whose actions are solely determined by unplanned actions without any heuristics. The random acts as a control group to evaluate the performance of other agents by comparing the performance.

Progress Summary  

As described in our Status Report, the project has created an agent with Deep Q Network whom can tackle the task of surviving from one Zombie in a limited cage. Two other agents has
