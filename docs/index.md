##### Our team, under the guidance of Professor Singh, aims to utilize what we have learn in Donald Bren School of Information and Computer Sciences ragarding intelligent systems and machine learning to created a Zombie Fighter in Minecraft Project Malmo. 

##### The world of Minecraft is a world of survivorship. Only the one who knows how to survive from endless Zombie attack would see the beauty of the world for another day.  The best actor would learn from experience and utilize sense from all direction to avoid close body combat with the Zombie.  Distance is an advantage that survivor agent must use. A sufficient distance from Zombie would provide a safer environment. So, let's survive ... In the harsh environment of Minecraft.
